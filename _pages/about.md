I am a 3rd year PhD candidate at MIT advised by [Daniela Rus](https://www.csail.mit.edu/) in the [Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab (CSAIL)](https://www.csail.mit.edu/).  My research focuses on making autonomous vehicles safer and more efficient.  Current research includes interactions between autonomous vehicles and human drivers, and multi-vehicle coordination at intersections.
My research is funded by the [National Defense Science & Engineering Graduate Fellowship](https://www.ndsegfellowships.org/).
