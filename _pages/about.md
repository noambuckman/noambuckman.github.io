I am a 3rd year PhD student at MIT advised by [Daniela Rus](https://www.csail.mit.edu/) in the [Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab (CSAIL)](https://www.csail.mit.edu/).  My research focuses on making autonomous vehicles safer and more efficient.  Current research includes dynamic task allocation for decentralized vehicles and effects of real-world communication in robot teams.  
My research is funded by the [National Defense Science & Engineering Graduate Fellowship](https://www.ndsegfellowships.org/).
