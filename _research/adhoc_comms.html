In this work, we test a real decentralized
communication system using a high bandwidth 802.11 ad-hoc
system with Raspberry Pis. We show that the communication
network quickly deteriorates at high broadcast speeds, leading
to worst performance as a team. In addition, while WiFi provides
carrier sensing to reduce collisions, the hidden neighbor problem
remains as a relevant problem for real-world systems. Finally, at
high communication speeds and large network sizes, the sheer
volume of messages may not be able to be processed by the
communication system and further delays and missed messages
can unexpectedly occur
